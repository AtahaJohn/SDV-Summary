		<dt>Where do I find the savegame?</dt>
		<dd>Savegames are in <code>%APPDATA%\StardewValley\Saves</code>. This can be pasted into the file upload box to find the correct folder. Within this are subfolders for individual savegames. The file you should upload is named after your player (i.e. not named SaveGameInfo).</dd>
		<dt>Can I upload multiple farms from the same playthrough?</dt>
		<dd>Yes. Other uploads  are automatically linked to below the farm name.</dd>
		<dt>I can't find my farm!</dt>
		<dd>Re-upload your farm and the site will redirect you to the existing data.</dd>
		<dt>How can I delete my upload(s)?</dt>
		<dd>When you upload a savegame a cookie is set to indicate ownership. Below the farm name should be a "delete this page" button. If you have uploaded multiple Farms from the same playthrough you will also have an option to delete "all for this farm". Both ask for confirmation before deleting.</dd>
